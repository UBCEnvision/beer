## Workshop
Student workshop presented at the AIChE Annual Student Meeting 2017. [AIChE Event Link](https://www.aiche.org/conferences/annual-aiche-student-conference/2017/events/student-chapter-career-workshops)

### 11:45am - 12:30pm: Internet of Brewing (IoB) - The Digital Revolution Meets Beer
#### Presented by: Athanasios Kritharis, Siang Lim, Shams Elnawawi, and Josh Donaldson
#### University of British Columbia Student Chapter
Do you enjoy beer? Fermentation started in the Bronze Age and is theorized to be the main driver behind the origin of civilization! However, controlling this biological process to achieve the desired characteristics of beer is challenging to this day. Large breweries employ sophisticated devices to control processes, thermodynamics, and to model kinetics, but homebrewers and craft breweries canâ€™t afford to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on high-end equipment. This workshop will demonstrate how to build a low-cost device that can monitor and control key process variables such as temperature and pH during the brewing process. Through the Internet of Things, it is possible to access and monitor process variables from anywhere! Come join us and learn how to make great beer from the comfort of your phone.
