See the Brewing SOP attached under resources at the bottom of the page. 

## Sanitizing
As mentioned in the workshop cleanliness is close to godliness! Ensure that you use 1 teaspoon per litre of water of SaniBrew and that you rinse with tap water after you sanitize. If any bacteria from the previous brew exists it can spoil your beer! 

## Mashing and Wort Preperation
Mashing: hot water steeping process which hydrates the barley, activates the malt enzymes, and converts the grain starches into fermentable sugars.
Wort: a sweet liquid drained from mash and fermented to make beer and whiskey
Use a hotplate to warm the grains with water in a heat safe container. Drain mash water and add it to pot with more water and malt extract. After the malt extract is dissolved add in the hops and bring to a boil. Keep the grains to the side and repurpose them if you desire. See the [Brewing SOP](BrewSOP.pdf) for a detailed step by step process. 

## Fermentation
Put yeast into mixture in fermenter and close it up! Place your bubble trap and wait for a week (or two depending on recipe). Once the bubbling has stopped that is a good indication fermentation has finished. 

## Bottling
Syphon beer into bottles and add priming sugar. Use capper to seal and wait for 4 week. *Do not refigerate during this time*.
